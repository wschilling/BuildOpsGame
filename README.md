# BuildOpsGame
This repository holds the BuildsOps educational game.  This game is design to teach high level DevSecOps principles to students and young professionals.

# Agile Sprint Simulation Overview

In this simulation, you’ll manage the project using **two-week Agile sprints**. Your objective is to decide how best to allocate your team’s efforts toward:

- Security enhancements  
- New features  
- A strategic combination of both  

---

## 🗂 Sprint Structure

Each sprint functions as follows:

- You’ll receive a set of **user story cards** for the sprint.
- Each card includes:
  - An option or action to take  
  - Its estimated cost (in story points)  
  - An estimated value or impact  
- Cards may represent:
  - Security improvements  
  - Testing actions (including fixes found during testing)  
  - Research tasks (which can unlock new opportunities)  
  - New feature development  

---

## 💰 Budget and Execution

- You begin each sprint with a budget of **11 story points**.
- You must stay within budget—**unused points do not carry over**.
- You’ll choose which actions to take, simulate two weeks of work, and then release updated versions of both the **app** and its **backend**.

---

## ⚠️ Dynamic Gameplay

As the game progresses:

- New options may become available based on **past decisions** and **research efforts**.
- The application is live—and **attackers may strike**.
- Success or failure depends on the **precautions and priorities** you established during previous sprints.

---

## 🛠 Simplified Assumptions

To keep things streamlined:

- The game skips over delays between release and deployment.
- Your development team is remarkably agile—capable of seamlessly shifting between:
  - Server-side and mobile work  
  - Coding, reviews, and penetration testing  
- Every task takes **exactly the number of story points estimated**, as long as it’s chosen during the sprint.

---

## 📣 Sprint Feedback

At the end of each sprint:

- You’ll deploy your release and receive feedback.
- Sometimes it’ll be good news.  
- Other times… there may be **NASTY SURPRISES** lurking.
